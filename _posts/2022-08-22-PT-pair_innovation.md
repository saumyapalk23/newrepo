# Innovation Sprint
> Focus for the week is to get started on how you will use GitHub Pages and FastPages to capture your learning by blogging. Innovation is a time to explore, learn, and obtain skills needed to reach goals.  Work with your pair to expand on your ideas, two heads is better than one.
- Learning how to Check setup work using Bash
- Capturing notes while building Fastpages/GitHub pages yearlong individual posts and notebooks.
- Review and enhance the Anatomy of Java; code using Java Primitives according to hacks or your own ideas.
- Establish positive PBL habits: a focused mindset in the classroom, using work habits to achieve success.  Plan your day, maximize your class time.  Anything below 75% productivity could impact your seed.

## Plans Week 1
> Discuss College Board Units 1 - 10; Discuss PBL; Innovate and Plan/Plan/Plan before Code/Code/Code. Always Code/Code/Code in classroom when schedule allows! Practice Pair Programming Habit of 30 minutes/30 minutes/1 commit each.

- Monday: "Live Review" with pairs. Try to Check setup work using Bash
- Tuesday: Test Prep - Discuss Unit 1: Primitive Data Types; College Board AP classroom overview; establish 10 week schedule to learn all 10 units.
- Wednesday: Agile and Roles - Code/Code/Code.
- Thursday: Fastpages - Code/Code/Code.
- Friday: Code/Code/Code.
