## Computer Science Principles A
- [Workshop Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15uDQfC0Gx-jaKFyQ1klGU4amqpqtqoAwOTSKgWaM8Ig/edit)
- [UCSD Site](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/cs-a-create-uc-san-diego/home?authuser=0)
- [The Place](https://place.fi.ncsu.edu/login/index.php) for [Computer Science A 2022 - UCSD](https://place.fi.ncsu.edu/course/view.php?id=456)
- [Code.org SignIn](https://studio.code.org/users/sign_in) and the [Code.org CSA Course](https://studio.code.org/courses/self-paced-pl-csa-2022)

### Monday Sessions
People introductions.  Much richer Teaching group.  Mostly from San Diego area.  Most think of the course as a mash up, meaning a complement to their knowledge and self made curriculum.

A lot on Code.org vision, big on equity word.  The APCSA curriculum is brand new.  Even the facilitators have not used it much.

8 virtual support sessions 5-7pm in evening during school year. 2-Day Capstone in Summer.

Played with their runtime environment.  It has proprietary libraries and imports from org.code (Code.org)

Draw a house design and detail discussion after.

Add these to lessons.

Creating Objects - https://youtu.be/C5Ks_u87Ltg

UML Diagram shown in slide.

Afternoon was spent playing with Painter object on Code.org platform.  This was interesting as they had a pedagogy idea to teach Object Oriented programming write at the start.  Could be a Unit 2 activity that is better than generic object activities that I am providing.

### Tuesday Sessions
[Slides for Day](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FatV2I5NjhtzYlMMDMPl7t4PRfxAhQaIfeLh3feFfFQ/edit#slide=id.g12e8fc2c951_0_28)


We were instructed to make Pseudo code, however, with short duration and explanation... The 3 of us did not talk about how each drawing is a 4 block square.

  ```
  Pseudo Code

  make PatternPainter class extended from PainterPlus
  setPaint(50)

  method paintRow
    while canMove
        paint 
        move 2
    face south (define it in PainterPlus)
    if canMove (built in)
      move
      face opposite (define it in PainterPlus)

  method paintMural
      while canMove
        call paintRow (above)

  ```

  Starting down a more traditional lessons on assignments of variables.  Also, show class and attributes being encapsulated.

  
  Attributes of a Class
  ```
    Hobby Class
    - Start Date
    - Hours
    - Dollars Spent

    Game extends Hobby
    - Console Type
    - Name
    - Cloud Play
    - Multi Player
    - Single Player
  ```
  
### Wednesday Sessions
> Wednesday was spent in Code.org Units 2 and 3.  Mostly it was related to Class definitions and started to move into Lists and iteration.  
- Class Paper fold over for vocabulary.  I suspected Student would not understand local and instance, new Teacher asked question on the subject.  Another sponsored project idea.
- Choosing you business, build a UML diagram.  Example on desserts: Cookie, Cupcake, Pie
- Bingo played and is interesting if administered correctly for vocabulary, this would be a great project that I would want to sponsor
- Last was something that could be done in Jupyter, have a list and answer a question.  All numbers larger than value...  In this there were purposeful algorithmic errors.

### Thursday Sessions
