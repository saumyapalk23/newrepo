## Plans Week 4
> Focus on FRQ No. 1 - Methods and Control Structures.
- Monday: Live Review
- Tuesday: Test Prep
- Wednesday: Career Tech
- Thursday: Human Prep
- Friday: Code, Code, Code


## Points will be awarded on these three key elements

### FRQ
> During the year we want to learn the four types of FRQs. This week we want to focus on the first type.
- FRQ No. 1: Methods and control structures (Focus)
    - Pick question type 01 from one of the years posted on the former EXAM page.  Solve the problem, including missing pieces in a Jupyter Notebook.  
    - Make this a quality blog.  My suggestion is Pairs do different FRQs and crossovers do the same, to make grading more valuable.
    - Browse through multiple questions, find a question that may be somewhat like a PBL interest.

> Future FRQs
- FRQ No. 2: Classes
- FRQ No. 3: Array/ArrayList
- FRQ No. 4: 2D Array 

### Iteration Mini-lab - 1
> It is really import that student learn to iterate through Arrays, ArrayLists, and 2D arrays.  The most important aspect of this lesson, all which can pop up in testing...
- Change or add data to the 2D arrays
- Displaying vertically and horizontally
- Display backwards or upside down

## Live Grading Presentation.  
> On Live grading day each team will present to 3 other Tables/Teams while presenting to the Teacher.  Each team will have 5-10 minutes to go over their FRQ, Mini-lab.
- Crossover Team Review and Review Ticket. 
    
> Presentation.  Introduce lesson and introduce how you plan to present the Material(s).  
- Have parts that each person will go over.
- Consider an activity or illustration other than Code, Code, Code to learn about Methods and Control Structures.
- Outside sources can be used to complement the lesson: College Board, Khan Academy, Code.org
- It would be interesting if you adapt Iteration Mini-lab and the Methods and Control Structures question to work together.  This would show your ability to plan and produce something useful.

> Every time Teacher Live Review requirements.
- Create Comment in this Points Blog.  Include crossover grades, crossover comments, and blog(s) used during week.
- Jupyter Notebooks contain comments and markdown cells that describe work.
- Output of Jupyter Notebook is required when posting the Blog.
