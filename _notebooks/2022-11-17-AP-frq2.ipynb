    "## Classes Background\n",
    "> All concepts in Classes FRQs can be used with POJOs in PBL. The 2019 FRQ #2 describes a problem of a Step Tracker. The task is to write a StepTracker class. Included is the constructor and any required instance variables and methods.\n",
    "- Constructor: StepTracker tr = new StepTracker(10000);\n",
    "- Get Methods with algorithms: tr.activeDays(); tr.averageSteps(); \n",
    "- Set Methods: tr.addDailySteps(9000);\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions to PBL this Project\n",
    "> This is a fun problem and could be expanded upon with PBL. The StepTracker could be a POJO in Java. As a PBL concept, StepTracking is something that is done by an individual in relation to their personal fitness. What designs or objects would you need for StepTracking...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Backend Assumptions:\n",
    "    - This problem has one-to-many relationship between \"Person\" object to day \"steps\" attributes.  \n",
    "    - Each day \"steps\" attribute would need to be stored.  \n",
    "    - Active days implies a \"Person\" object needs a \"goal_steps\" attribute to be stored to compare against the \"steps\" attribute for a day.\n",
    "    - Person Class. Contact and biographical information, like age/height/weight could be important to this application. Such information could be used to help calculate goals for \"steps\".\n",
    "    - Day statistics in Class could go beyond \"steps\". Though \"steps\" is key element. Additional attributes could  include walking or running time, calorie intake, sleep hours, mood ratio, or other factors that could help in determining goal versus accomplishments.\n",
    "    - Other relationships. A daily collection of \"stats\" implies calculations for Month or Year. Investigation should be made to determine best Java Modeling and Algorithms available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Frontend Assumptions:\n",
    "    - A person's steps need to be recorded by a person in the Frontend\n",
    "    - A person would need to view or perform analytics on self, perhaps a daily step chart.\n",
    "    - A person might want to know about how they met or missed goals versus food calorie intake, hours slept, mood ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting the Project\n",
    "> To study Classes, which is the intent of FRQ2, A PBL project step tracking seems to begin with a \"Person\" Class. This may deviate from FRQ 2 simplicity, but it is a higher-level way to approach this problem.\n",
    "\n",
